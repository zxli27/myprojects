# IMDB Sentimental Analysis

## Intro
Sentimental Analysis for IMDB movie reviews is a group project.<br />
It uses word embedding methods Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. <br />
Models used include linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, random forest, logistics, and Gaussian Bayes.

## My work in the project includes:
* finished the study of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec completely
* participated in writing the code
* make the final presentation for the project

## Result
 * Random Forest (given Word2Vec features) 84.42% <br />
 * Random Forest (given Doc2Vec features) 84.46% <br />
 * Gaussian Bayes (given Word2Vec features) 75.98% <br />
 * Gaussian Bayes (given Doc2Vec features) 82.22% <br />
 * Logistics (given Word2Vec features) 87.90% <br />
 * Logistics (given Doc2Vec features) 88.04% <br />
 * Linear SVM (given Word2Vec features) 87.28% <br />
 * Linear SVM (given Doc2Vec features) 88% <br />
 * Gaussian SVM (given Word2Vec features) 87.68% <br />
 * Gaussian SVM (given Doc2Vec features) 87.9%<br />
